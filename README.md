# Voice-X
In modern world, social media and the internet plays a very big role on how we perceive society, and how it actually works. It has both negative and positive impact. We wanted to focus on the positive sides, explore the potential it has and that's how we came up with voice-x, getting your voice heard right!

# What it does
voice-x is a modern day application that focuses on civic engagement and empowers the greatness of crowdfunding and support of general citizens. voice-x lets you upvote campaigns of your choice, donate to the ones that are requiring money, create your own campaign and garner support from people from all over the world. We are keen on making the app as usable and to the point as possible. For that, we've kept a really sleek and simple User Interface where you can easily navigate through features and use the app efficiently.
